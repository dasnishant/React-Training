Go through SCSS

Practise redux, useSelector, reducers as pure functions, connect(refer docs for all)

2 weeks --> Instagram clone (Home Page, Profile)
Instagram clone start it after going  through redux(practise) 

Learnings:

1. Whenever there's change in some UI(like show element on hover) first try to achieve all those things
using CSS/SCSS, do not use State for all such things.

2. When adding event for eg: onClick never use arrow functions in it as it creates instance of it every time
an event occurs
Can be best explained with example:
first way:

const setTab = (val) => () => {
        settab(val);
    };

second way:

function setTab(val) {
    return () => {
      settab(val);
    };
}

onClick={setTab("all")} //event
onClick={()=>settab('all)}  //this creates instance every single time 

3. Keep all your logic and data in Main component and all the subcomponents should be dumb component
(i.e. its work should only be of displaying that component and no logic)

4. Reducers:
        Create seperate file for each reducer, put loadingState, errorState, etc. for each particular reducers,
        but there are cases where we write reducers for only Modal,etc.

5. Routing should be handled in seperate Component.
